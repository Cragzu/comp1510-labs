'''
Get two strings representing primary colours, create functions that go through a sequence of if statements to find 
the secondary colour they will mix into and print it; or print an error message if the input is invalid.

    red + yellow = orange, red + blue = purple, blue + yellow = green

Computational thinking:
    Decomposition: First consider all cases when one colour exists, then move on to the other. Make helper functions
    that will allow this program to work as efficiently as possible using only the basics of Python.
    Pattern matching: Noticing that if red does not exist, the only possible options are yellow and blue. Don't bother
    repeating code by checking things twice.
